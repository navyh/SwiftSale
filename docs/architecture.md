# Architecture Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the SwiftSale application architecture, design patterns, and system organization.

## System Architecture

SwiftSale is built as a client-side rendered Next.js application that communicates with a RESTful API backend. The application follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns.

## Frontend Architecture

The frontend architecture follows Next.js App Router patterns with a focus on component reusability and separation of concerns.

### Key Architectural Patterns

1. **Page-based Routing**: Using Next.js App Router for declarative, file-system based routing
2. **Component-based UI**: Modular UI components built with React and Tailwind CSS
3. **Custom Hooks**: Encapsulating reusable logic in custom React hooks
4. **API Client**: Centralized API client for all backend communication
5. **Context-based State Management**: Using React Context API for global state management

### Directory Structure

The application follows a feature-based directory structure:

```
src/
├── app/                 # Next.js App Router pages
│   ├── products/        # Product management pages
│   ├── orders/          # Order management pages
│   ├── procurements/    # Procurement management pages
│   ├── users/           # User management pages
│   └── settings/        # Settings pages
├── components/          # Reusable UI components
│   ├── ui/              # Base UI components (shadcn/ui)
│   └── layout/          # Layout components
├── hooks/               # Custom React hooks
└── lib/                 # Utility functions and API client
```

## Data Flow

The application follows a unidirectional data flow pattern:

1. **User Interaction**: User interacts with the UI
2. **State Update**: Component state or global context is updated
3. **API Request**: Data is sent to the backend via the API client
4. **Response Handling**: API response is processed and state is updated
5. **UI Update**: UI is re-rendered with the updated state

### API Integration

The application uses a custom API client (`src/lib/apiClient.ts`) to communicate with the backend. The API client:

- Handles authentication
- Manages request/response formatting
- Provides type-safe API interfaces
- Centralizes error handling

## State Management

SwiftSale uses a combination of state management approaches:

1. **Local Component State**: For UI-specific state using React's `useState` hook
2. **Form State**: Using `react-hook-form` for form state management
3. **Global State**: Using custom hooks and React Context API for shared state
4. **Server State**: Fetched from the API and cached as needed

## Authentication Flow

The application uses token-based authentication:

1. User credentials are sent to the authentication endpoint
2. JWT token is received and stored (implementation details in apiClient.ts)
3. Token is included in subsequent API requests
4. Token refresh logic handles token expiration

## Error Handling

The application implements a centralized error handling strategy:

1. API errors are caught and processed in the API client
2. UI errors are displayed using toast notifications
3. Form validation errors are handled by react-hook-form
4. Global error boundaries catch unexpected errors

## Performance Considerations

The application implements several performance optimizations:

1. **Code Splitting**: Automatic code splitting by Next.js
2. **Lazy Loading**: Components and pages are loaded on demand
3. **Memoization**: Using React.memo and useMemo for expensive calculations
4. **Debouncing**: For search inputs and other frequent user interactions

## Security Considerations

The application implements several security measures:

1. **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated
2. **Authentication**: Token-based authentication for API requests
3. **Authorization**: Role-based access control for different features
4. **Data Sanitization**: Preventing XSS and injection attacks
