# Development Workflow

This document outlines the development workflow, coding standards, version control practices, and other best practices for developers working on the SwiftSale project.

## Development Process

### Agile Development

SwiftSale follows an Agile development process:

1. **Sprint Planning**: Define tasks and priorities for the upcoming sprint
2. **Daily Stand-ups**: Brief team meetings to discuss progress and blockers
3. **Sprint Review**: Demo completed features at the end of each sprint
4. **Sprint Retrospective**: Reflect on the sprint and identify improvements

### Task Management

Tasks are managed using a task tracking system (e.g., Jira, GitHub Issues):

1. **Backlog**: All planned features and improvements
2. **Sprint Backlog**: Tasks selected for the current sprint
3. **In Progress**: Tasks currently being worked on
4. **Review**: Tasks awaiting code review
5. **Done**: Completed tasks

### Feature Development Lifecycle

1. **Task Assignment**: Developer is assigned a task from the sprint backlog
2. **Branch Creation**: Create a feature branch from the main branch
3. **Implementation**: Develop the feature with appropriate tests
4. **Testing**: Ensure the feature works as expected and passes all tests
5. **Code Review**: Submit a pull request for code review
6. **Revisions**: Address feedback from the code review
7. **Merge**: Merge the feature branch into the main branch
8. **Deployment**: Deploy the changes to the appropriate environment

## Version Control

### Git Workflow

SwiftSale uses a feature branch workflow:

1. **Main Branch**: The main branch (`main` or `master`) always contains stable, production-ready code
2. **Feature Branches**: New features are developed in feature branches
3. **Release Branches**: Created for release preparation and bug fixes
4. **Hotfix Branches**: Created for urgent fixes to production

### Branch Naming Convention

```
<type>/<issue-number>-<short-description>
```

Examples:
- `feature/123-add-product-filtering`
- `bugfix/456-fix-order-calculation`
- `refactor/789-improve-api-client`
- `docs/234-update-readme`

### Commit Message Convention

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

Examples:
- `feat(products): add product filtering`
- `fix(orders): correct GST calculation`
- `docs(readme): update installation instructions`
- `refactor(api): improve error handling`

Types:
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

### Pull Request Process

1. **Create a Pull Request**: Submit a pull request from your feature branch to the main branch
2. **PR Description**: Include a clear description of the changes, the issue it resolves, and any testing done
3. **Code Review**: At least one team member must review and approve the changes
4. **CI Checks**: All automated tests and checks must pass
5. **Merge**: Once approved and all checks pass, the PR can be merged

## Coding Standards

### General Guidelines

- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- Keep functions and components small and focused
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic, but prefer self-documenting code
- Handle errors appropriately

### TypeScript Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Define interfaces for all data structures
- Use proper type annotations for function parameters and return values
- Avoid using `any` type when possible
- Use type guards for runtime type checking

Example:

```typescript
// Good
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email?: string;
}

function getUserName(user: User): string {
  return user.name;
}

// Bad
function getUserName(user: any): any {
  return user.name;
}
```

### React Guidelines

- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use proper prop types with TypeScript interfaces
- Memoize expensive calculations with `useMemo`
- Memoize callback functions with `useCallback` when passing to child components
- Use the React DevTools for debugging

Example:

```tsx
// Good
interface UserCardProps {
  user: User;
  onEdit: (userId: string) => void;
}

function UserCard({ user, onEdit }: UserCardProps) {
  const handleEdit = useCallback(() => {
    onEdit(user.id);
  }, [onEdit, user.id]);

  return (
    <Card>
      <CardHeader>{user.name}</CardHeader>
      <CardContent>{/* Content */}</CardContent>
      <CardFooter>
        <Button onClick={handleEdit}>Edit</Button>
      </CardFooter>
    </Card>
  );
}

// Bad
function UserCard(props) {
  return (
    <Card>
      <CardHeader>{props.user.name}</CardHeader>
      <CardContent>{/* Content */}</CardContent>
      <CardFooter>
        <Button onClick={() => props.onEdit(props.user.id)}>Edit</Button>
      </CardFooter>
    </Card>
  );
}
```

### CSS/Styling Guidelines

SwiftSale uses Tailwind CSS for styling:

- Use Tailwind utility classes for styling
- Follow the mobile-first approach for responsive design
- Use consistent spacing and sizing
- Extract common patterns to components
- Use CSS variables for theme colors and other design tokens

Example:

```tsx
// Good
<div className="flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-4 p-4 bg-background rounded-lg">
  <div className="flex-1">{/* Content */}</div>
  <div className="flex-1">{/* Content */}</div>
</div>

// Bad
<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', gap: '1rem', padding: '1rem', backgroundColor: '#f5f5f5', borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}>
  <div style={{ flex: 1 }}>{/* Content */}</div>
  <div style={{ flex: 1 }}>{/* Content */}</div>
</div>
```

## Testing

### Testing Strategy

SwiftSale follows a comprehensive testing strategy:

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and components in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between components
3. **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete user flows

### Test Coverage

Aim for high test coverage, especially for critical business logic:

- Business logic: 90%+ coverage
- UI components: 80%+ coverage
- Utility functions: 90%+ coverage

### Writing Effective Tests

- Test behavior, not implementation details
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Mock external dependencies
- Keep tests independent and isolated

Example:

```tsx
// Good
describe('calculateOrderTotal', () => {
  it('should calculate the correct total for items with tax', () => {
    // Arrange
    const items = [
      { price: 100, quantity: 2, taxRate: 0.1 },
      { price: 50, quantity: 1, taxRate: 0.05 },
    ];
    
    // Act
    const total = calculateOrderTotal(items);
    
    // Assert
    expect(total).toBe(272.5); // (100 * 2 * 1.1) + (50 * 1 * 1.05)
  });
});

// Bad
test('calculateOrderTotal works', () => {
  const items = [{ price: 100, quantity: 2, taxRate: 0.1 }];
  expect(calculateOrderTotal(items)).toBe(220);
});
```

## Performance Optimization

### General Guidelines

- Minimize unnecessary renders
- Use pagination for large data sets
- Implement proper loading states
- Optimize images and assets
- Use code splitting for large components

### React Performance

- Use `React.memo` for components that render often with the same props
- Use `useCallback` for functions passed as props
- Use `useMemo` for expensive calculations
- Use the React DevTools Profiler to identify performance issues

Example:

```tsx
// Good
const MemoizedComponent = React.memo(function ExpensiveComponent({ data }) {
  // Component implementation
});

function ParentComponent() {
  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
    // Handler implementation
  }, []);

  const processedData = useMemo(() => {
    return expensiveCalculation(data);
  }, [data]);

  return <MemoizedComponent data={processedData} onClick={handleClick} />;
}

// Bad
function ParentComponent() {
  const processedData = expensiveCalculation(data); // Recalculated on every render
  
  return <ExpensiveComponent data={processedData} onClick={() => {}} />; // New function on every render
}
```

## Debugging

### Tools and Techniques

- Use the browser's DevTools for debugging
- Use the React DevTools for component inspection
- Use console.log strategically (but remove before committing)
- Use breakpoints for step-by-step debugging
- Use error boundaries to catch and handle errors

### Common Issues

- Check for typos in prop names
- Verify that all required props are being passed
- Check for infinite loops in useEffect
- Verify that state updates are working as expected
- Check for race conditions in async code

## Deployment

### Environments

SwiftSale has multiple deployment environments:

1. **Development**: For active development and testing
2. **Staging**: For pre-production testing
3. **Production**: The live environment for end users

### Deployment Process

1. **Build**: Create a production build
2. **Test**: Run automated tests
3. **Deploy**: Deploy the build to the target environment
4. **Verify**: Verify that the deployment was successful
5. **Monitor**: Monitor for any issues after deployment

### Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

SwiftSale uses CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment:

1. **Continuous Integration**: Automated tests run on every pull request
2. **Continuous Deployment**: Automated deployment to the appropriate environment after merging

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Use JSDoc comments for functions and components
- Document complex logic with inline comments
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes

Example:

```typescript
/**
 * Calculates the total price of an order including tax.
 * 
 * @param {OrderItem[]} items - The items in the order
 * @returns {number} The total price including tax
 */
function calculateOrderTotal(items: OrderItem[]): number {
  return items.reduce((total, item) => {
    const itemTotal = item.price * item.quantity;
    const taxAmount = itemTotal * item.taxRate;
    return total + itemTotal + taxAmount;
  }, 0);
}
```

### Project Documentation

- Keep the README up-to-date
- Document architecture decisions
- Document business logic and domain concepts
- Document API endpoints and data structures

## Collaboration

### Communication

- Use clear and concise communication
- Document decisions and discussions
- Share knowledge with the team
- Ask for help when needed

### Code Reviews

- Be respectful and constructive
- Focus on the code, not the person
- Provide specific feedback
- Explain the reasoning behind suggestions
- Acknowledge good work

### Knowledge Sharing

- Document complex features
- Share learnings with the team
- Conduct tech talks or workshops
- Mentor junior developers

## Conclusion
